# Saturday Nov 7: start here

Team **Wasian**. Presenting Sun Nov 8, **10:26 to 10:34 am** (6 min with demo, 2 min Q&A). Submission closes Sun **9:00 am**.

This folder is the plan for Saturday. It overrides `planning/08_saturday_plan.md`, `planning/09_tool_plan_update.md` and `planning/08_product_decisions.md` where they differ. Where this folder says nothing, 09 applies, then 08 plus amendments A to L.

## If you are a teammate's Claude
1. Read this file.
2. Read your person's brief in `people/<name>.md` (kent, marco, everett, noah, matthew). Start on its first unchecked step.
3. Read `03_contract.md` before writing any file. It says which files you own and the shape of `payload.json`.
4. Read other files here only when your brief points to them.

Rules that apply all day:
- Edit only the files your brief says you own. Need a change in someone else's file? Write it in your brief's "Handoff" section and tell your person to tell the owner.
- Do not edit `src/R/00_config.R`. Put any new setting at the top of your own script, marked `# TODO move to 00_config.R`, and list it in your Handoff section. Kent moves it at the merge.
- Work on a branch named `<name>/sat-<topic>` (for example `everett/sat-backtest`). Commit and push that branch. Never commit to `main`, never merge, never force-push. Kent merges only at the merge windows in `00_timeline.md`.
- Numbers on slides or in docs come only from `src/docs/fact_sheet.md`. Never invent a number, source or quote. Write "not found".
- An LLM labels with a quote; it never decides. Award history never goes into the score.
- Log every AI use in `AI_USAGE_LOG.md`.
- Stuck more than 20 minutes, or any merge conflict: stop and tell your person to message Kent.
