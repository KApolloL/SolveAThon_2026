# keyword_baseline.R  (source this file; it defines functions and runs nothing)
#
# WHAT THIS IS: the simple comparison method. It mimics what a person does with a
# keyword search: take the words in an agency's goals, and count how many of those
# words show up in each opportunity's title and summary.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is NOT our ranker. It exists only so we can say what our
# ranker finds that a plain keyword search misses.
#
# KNOWN WEAKNESS (on purpose, not a bug): generic words produce false positives
# (for example "water", "school", "resources" appear in many unrelated notices),
# and a notice that uses different words than the plan is missed entirely.
# We drop a stopword list and a short list of very generic words, but any list
# like this is a judgment call. Edit GENERIC_WORDS below if Kent wants it stricter.
#
# Deterministic: no randomness. Ties are broken by opp_id (text order).
